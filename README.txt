Introduction

1.1  What is robotpkg?

The robotics research community has always been developing a lot of software,
in order to illustrate theoretical concepts and validate algorithms on board
real robots. A great amount of this software was made freely available to the
community, especially for Unix-based systems, and is usually available in form
of the source code. Therefore, before such software can be used, it needs to be
configured to the local system, compiled and installed. This is exactly what
The Robotics Packages Collection (robotpkg) does. robotpkg also has some basic
commands to handle binary packages, so that not every user has to build the
packages for himself, which is a time-costly, cumbersome and error-prone task.
The robotpkg project was initiated in the Laboratory for Analysis and
Architecture of Systems (CNRS/LAAS), France. The motivation was, on the one
hand, to ease the software maintenance tasks for the robots that are used
there. On the other hand, roboticists at CNRS/LAAS have always fostered an
open-source development model for the software they were developing. In order
to help people working with the laboratory to get the LAAS software running
outside the laboratory, a package management system was necessary.
Although robotpkg was an innovative project in the robotics community (it
started in 2006), a lot of general-purpose software packages management systems
were readily available at this time for a great variety of Unix-based systems.
The main requirements that we wanted robotpkg to fullfill were listed and the
best existing package management system was chosen as a starting point. The
biggest requirement was the capacity of the system to adapt to the nature of
the robotic software, being available mostly in form of source code only (no
binary packages), with unfrequent stable releases. robotpkg had thus to deal
mostly with source code and automate the compilation of the packages. The
system chosen as a starting point was The NetBSD Packages Collection (pkgsrc).
robotpkg can be considered as a fork of this project and it is still very
similar to pkgsrc in many points, although some simplifications were made in
order to provide a tool geared toward people that are not computer scientists
but roboticists.
Due to its origins, robotpkg provides many packages developed at LAAS. It is
however not limited to such packages and contains, in fact, quite some other
software useful to roboticists. Of course, robotpkg is not meant to be a
general purpose packaging system (although there would be no technical
restriction to this) and will never contain widely available packages that can
be found on any modern Unix distribution. Yet, robotpkg currently contains
roughly one hundred and fifty packages, including:

  * architecture/genom - The LAAS Generator of Robotic Components
  * simulation/openhrp - The Open Architecture Humanoid Robotics Platform from
    AIST, Japan
  * architecture/openrtm - The robotic distributed middleware from AIST, Japan
  * middleware/yarp - The "other", yet famous, robot platform
  * ...just to name a few.

1.2  Why robotpkg?

robotpkg provides the following key features:

  * Easy building of software from source as well as the creation and
    installation of binary packages. The source and latest patches are
    retrieved from a master download site, checksum verified, then built on
    your system.
  * All packages are installed in a consistent directory tree, including
    binaries, libraries, man pages and other documentation.
  * Package dependencies, including when performing package updates, are
    handled automatically.
  * The installation prefix, acceptable software licenses and build-time
    options for a large number of packages are all set in a simple, central
    configuration file.
  * The entire framework source (not including the package distribution files
    themselves) is freely available under a BSD license, so you may extend and
    adapt robotpkg to your needs, like robotpkg was adapted from pkgsrc.

One question often asked by people is "why was robotpkg forked from pkgsrc
instead of integrating the packages into pkgsrc?". This is indeed a very good
question and the following paragraphs try to answer it.
First, robotpkg is not meant to be a replacement for the system's package
management tool (it does not superseeds pkgsrc, dpkg, macports etc.). The goal
is to package software that is not widely available on a platform, and which is
mostly "lab software" (generally of lesser quality than widely available
software). Those packages change (a lot) more often, and more drastically.
Thus, robotpkg is a little bit closer to a "development" tool than pkgsrc.
Other "system packages" are correctly handled by a number of packaging tools,
and there is no need for a new tool.
Currently, pkgsrc mixes both infrastructure and packages descriptions
themselves. For someone working on e.g. Linux, checking-out the whole pkgsrc
tree would be cumbersome: it would be redundant with the base Linux package
system, plus it would be difficult to isolate the specific robotic packages
from the rest (the rest usually being available in the base system). robotpkg
currently suffers from the same symptom: this may change in the future if the
need for several package repositories becomes blatant.
robotpkg provides a number of features not available in pkgsrc (and probably
not really useful to pkgsrc either). The most important feature is to be able
to detect ssystem packages", that are considered as e:xternal software not in
robotpkg but usually available on a unix system". pkgsrc has a similar system
but much more limited - to a few base packages only. This is so because pkgsrc
is a full-fledged package system. Thus, it aims at being self contained, while
robotpkg does not.
Finally, there are a number of additions/changes to the pkgsrc infrastructure
that correspond to legitimate users requests and the specifc workflow in which
robotpkg is used. For instance, robotpkg provides the possibility to generate
an archive of a package from a specific tag in a source repository "on the fly"
or just bypass the archive generation and work directly from the source
repository to install the software. This later workflow is not encouraged, but
it is convenient to quickly test a -current version of some software to see if
it causes any problem. Those features could be ported back to pkgsrc if the
pkgsrc team would find them useful. In the meantime, robotpkg provides a good
testbed for them.
Still, robotpkg directly uses many of the pkgsrc tools unchanged and the binary
packages are fully compatible.

1.3  Supported platforms

robotpkg consists of a source distribution. After retrieving the required
source, you can be up and running with robotpkg in just minutes!
robotpkg does not have much requirements by itself and it can work on a wide
variety of systems as long as they provide a GNU-make utility, a working
C-compiler and a small, reasonably standard subset of Unix commands (like sed,
awk, find, grep ...). However, individual packages might have their specific
requirements. The following platforms have been reported to be supported
reasonably well:
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Platform|                              Version                              |

1.4  Overview

This document is divided into three parts. The first one describes how one can
use one of the packages in the Robotics Package Collection, either by
installing a precompiled binary package, or by building one's own copy using
robotpkg. The second part explains how to prepare a package so it can be easily
built by other users without knowing about the package's building details. The
third part is intended for those who want to understand how robotpkg is
implemented.

1.5  Terminology

Here is a description of all the terminology used within this document.

Package
    A set of files and building instructions that describe what's necessary to
    build a certain piece of software using robotpkg. Packages are
    traditionally stored under /opt/robotpkg.
robotpkg
    This is the The Robotics Package Collection. It handles building
    (compiling), installing, and removing of packages.
Distfile
    This term describes the file or files that are provided by the author of
    the piece of software to distribute his work. All the changes necessary to
    build are reflected in the corresponding package. Usually the distfile is
    in the form of a compressed tar-archive, but other types are possible, too.
    Distfiles are usually stored below /opt/robotpkg/distfiles.
Precompiled/binary package
    A set of binaries built with robotpkg from a distfile and stuffed together
    in a single .tgz file so it can be installed on machines of the same
    machine architecture without the need to recompile. Packages are usually
    generated in /opt/robotpkg/packages.
    Sometimes, this is referred to by the term "package" too, especially in the
    context of precompiled packages.
Program
    The piece of software to be installed which will be constructed from all
    the files in the distfile by the actions defined in the corresponding
    package.

1.6  Roles involved in robotpkg

robotpkg users
    The robotpkg users are people who use the packages provided by robotpkg.
    Typically they are student working in robotics. The usage of the software
    that is inside the packages is not covered by the robotpkg guide.
    There are two kinds of robotpkg users: Some only want to install pre-built
    binary packages. Others build the robotpkg packages from source, either for
    installing them directly or for building binary packages themselves. For
    robotpkg users, Part 2 should provide all necessary documentation.
package maintainers
    A package maintainer creates packages as described in Part 3.
infrastructure developers
    These people are involved in all those files that live in the mk/ directory
    and below. Only these people should need to read through Part 4, though
    others might be curious, too.

1.7  Typography

When giving examples for commands, shell prompts are used to show if the
command should/can be issued as root, or if "normal" user privileges are
sufficient. We use a # for root's shell prompt, and a % for users' shell
prompt, assuming they use the C-shell or tcsh.

2
The robotpkg user's guide

Basically, there are two ways of using robotpkg. The first is to only install
the package tools and to use binary packages that someone else has prepared.
The second way is to install the programs from source. Then you are able to
build your own packages, and you can still use binary packages from someone
else. Sections in this document will detail both approaches where appropriate.

2.1  Where to get robotpkg and how to keep it up-to-date

Before you download and extract the files, you need to decide where you want to
extract them and where you want robotpkg to install packages. By defaut, the /
opt/openrobots directory is used. In the rest of this document, the
installation path is called the prefix.
robotpkg will never require administration privileges by itself. We thus
recommend that you do not install or run robotpkg as the root user. If
something ever goes really wrong, it might go less wrong if it is not running
as root. If you want to install to the default location /opt/openrobots, we
recommend that you create this directory owned by a regular user.
Creating or using /opt/openrobots typically requires administration ( a.k.a.
"root") privileges. If you don't have such privileges (or if you want to
install to a different location), you have to unpack the sources and install
the binary packages in another prefix. If you don't have any special
administration rights on the target machine, a safe bet is to choose the $HOME/
openrobots location, as the $HOME directory will always be writable by
yourself.
Any prefix will work, but please note that you should choose an installation
path which is dedicated to robotpkg packages and not shared with other programs
(e.g., we do not recommend to use a prefix of /usr). Also, you should not try
to add any of your own files or directories (such as src/) below the prefix
tree. This will prevent possible conflicts between programs and other files
installed by the package system and whatever else may have been installed
there.
Finally, the installation path shall not contain white-space or other
characters that are interpreted specially by the shell and some other programs:
use only letters, digits, underscores and dashes.
The rest of this document will assume that you are using /opt/openrobots as the
prefix. You should adapt this path to whatever prefix you choosed.

2.1.1  Getting the binary bootstrap kit

At the moment, the binary bootstrap kit is not available. Please get the
robotpkg sources as described in the next section.

2.1.2  Getting robotpkg for source compilation

robotpkg sources are distributed via the git software content management
system. git will probably be readily available on your system but if you don't
have it installed or if you are unsure about it, contact your local system
administrator.
There are two download methods: the anonymous one and the authenticated one:

  * Anonymous download is the recommended method if you don't intend to work on
    the robotpkg infrastructure itself, nor commit any changes or packages
    additions back to the robotpkg main repository. Furthermore, the
    possibility to send contributions via patches is still open.
    As your regular user, simply run in a shell:

    % cd /opt/openrobots
    % git clone http://softs.laas.fr/git/robots/robotpkg.git


  * Authenticated download requires a valid login on the main robotpkg
    repository, and will give you full commit access to this repository. Simply
    run the following:

    % cd /opt/openrobots
    % git clone ssh://softs.laas.fr/git/robots/robotpkg


2.1.3  Keeping robotpkg up-to-date

robotpkg is a living thing: updates to the packages are made perdiodicaly,
problems are fixed, enhancements are developed... If you downloaded the
robotpkg sources via git, you should keep it up-to-date so that you get the
most recent packages descriptions. This is done by running git pull in the
robotpkg source directory:

% cd /opt/openrobots/robotpkg
% git pull


When you update robotpkg, the git program will only touch those files that are
registered in the git repository. That means that any packages that you created
on your own will stay unmodified. If you change files that are managed by git,
later updates will try to merge your changes with those that have been done by
others. See the git-pull manual for details.
If you want to be informed of package additions and other updates, a public
mailing list is available for your reading pleasure. Go to https://
sympa.laas.fr/sympa/info/robotpkg for more information and subscription.

2.2  Bootstrapping robotpkg

Once you have downloaded the robotpkg sources or the binary bootstrap kit as
described in Section 2.1, a minimal set of the administrative package
management utilities must be installed on your system before you can use
robotpkg. This is called the "bootstrap phase" and should be done only once,
the very first time you download robotpkg.

2.2.1  Bootstrapping via the binary kit

At the moment, the binary bootstrap kit is not available. Please bootstrap
robotpkg as described in the next section.

2.2.2  Bootstrapping from source

You will need a working C compiler and the GNU-make utility version 3.81 or
later. If you have extracted the robotpkg archive into the standard /opt/
openrobots/robotpkg location, installing the bootstrap kit from source should
then be as simple as:

% cd /opt/openrobots/robotpkg/bootstrap
% ./bootstrap


This will install various utilities into /opt/openrobots/sbin.
Should you prefer another installation path, you could use the --prefix option
to change the default installation prefix. For instance, configuring robotpkg
to install programs into the openrobots directory in your home directory can be
done like this:

% cd robotpkg/bootstrap
% ./bootstrap --prefix=${HOME}/openrobots


After the bootstrap script has run, a message indicating the success should be
displayed. If you choosed a non-standard installation path, read this message
carefuly, as it contains instructions that you have to follow in order to setup
your shell environment correctly. These instructions are described in the next
section.

Configuring your environment

If you configured robotpkg, during the bootstrap phase, to install to some
other location than /opt/openrobots, you have to setup manually your shell
environment so that it contains a few variables holding the installation path.
Assuming you invoked bootstrap with -prefix=/path/to/openrobots, you have two
options that are compatible with each other:

  * Add the directory /path/to/openrobots/sbin to your PATH variable. robotpkg
    will then be able to find its administrative tools automatically and from
    that recover other configuration information. This is the preferred method.
  * Create the environment variable ROBOTPKG_BASE and set its value to /path/to
    /openrobots. robotpkg will look for this variable first, so it takes
    precedence over the first method. This is the method you have to choose if
    you have configured several instances of robotpkg in your system. This is
    ony useful in some circumstances and is not normally needed.

If you don't know how to setup environment variables permanently in your
system, please refer to your shell's manual or contact your local system
administrator.

The bootstrap script usage

The bootstrap script will by default install the package administrative tools
in /opt/openrobots/sbin, use gcc as the C compiler and make as the GNU-make
program. This behaviour can be fine-tuned by using the following options:

--prefix <path>
    will select the prefix location where programs will be installed in.
--sysconfdir <path>
    defaults to <prefix>/etc. This is the path to the robotpkg configuration
    file. Other packages configuration files (if any) will also be stored in
    this directory.
--pkgdbdir <path>
    defaults to <prefix>/var/db/pkg. This is the path to the package database
    directory where robotpkg will do its internal bookkeeping.
--compiler <program>
    defaults to gcc. Use this option if you want to use a different C compiler.
--make <program>
    defaults to make. Use this option if you want to use a different make
    program. This program should be compatible with GNU-make.
--help
    displays the bootstrap usage. The comprehensive list of recognized options
    will be displayed.

2.3  Using robotpkg

After obtaining robotpkg , the robotpkg directory now contains a set of
packages, organized into categories. You can browse the online index of
packages, or run make index from the robotpkg directory to build local
index.html files for all packages, viewable with any web browser such as lynx
or firefox.

2.3.1  Building packages from source

The first step for building a package is downloading the distfiles (i.e. the
unmodified source). If they have not yet been downloaded, robotpkg will fetch
them automatically and place them in the robotpkg/distfiles directory.
Once the software has been downloaded, any patches will be applied and the
package will be compiled for you. This may take some time depending on your
computer, and how many other packages the software depends on and their compile
time.
For example, type the following commands at the shell prompt to build the
robotpkg documentation package:

% cd /opt/openrobots/robotpkg
% cd doc/robotpkg
% make


The next stage is to actually install the newly compiled package onto your
system. While you are still in the directory for whatever package you are
installing, you can do this by entering:

% make install


Installing the package on your system does not require you to be root (except
for a few specific packages). However, if you bootstraped with a prefix for
which you don't have writing permissions, robotpkg has a just-in-time-sudo
feature, which allows you to become root for the actual installation step.
That's it, the software should now be installed under the prefix of the
packages tree - /opt/openrobots by default - and setup for use.
You can now enter:

% make clean


to remove the compiled files in the work directory, as you shouldn't need them
any more. If other packages were also added to your system (dependencies) to
allow your program to compile, you can also tidy these up with the command:

% make clean-depends


Since the three tasks of building, installing and cleaning correspond to the
typical usage of robotpkg , a helper target doing all these tasks exists and is
called update. Thus, to intall a package with a single command, you can simply
run:

% make update


In addition, make update will also recompile all the installed packages that
were depending on the package that you are updating. This can be quite time
consuming if you are updating a low-level package. Also, note that all packages
that depend on the package you are updating will be deinstalled first and
unavailable in your system until all packages are recompiled and reinstalled.
Occasionally, people want to "look under the covers" to see what is going on
when a package is building or being installed. This may be for debugging
purposes, or out of simple curiosity. A number of utility values have been
added to help with this.

 1. If you invoke the make command with PKG_DEBUG_LEVEL=1, then a huge amount
    of information will be displayed. For example,

    % make patch PKG_DEBUG_LEVEL=1


    will show all the commands that are invoked, up to and including the
    "patch" stage. Using PKG_DEBUG_LEVEL=2 will give you even more details.
 2. If you want to know the value of a certain make definition, then the
    VARNAME variable should be used, in conjunction with the show-var target.
    e.g. to show the expansion of the make variable LOCALBASE:

    % make show-var VARNAME=LOCALBASE


2.3.2  Building packages from a repository checkout

Before building a package, robotpkg fetches the sources from the official(s)
download location(s), as instructed by the MASTER_SITES variable. This is the
standard and expected behaviour when you work with stable packages.
Occasionally, though, it is useful to fetch a snapshot of the sources from a
development repository. For instance, one might want to quickly test a release
candidate of a package, or fix a simple bug and create a patch from the fix.
Whenever a package defines the MASTER_REPOSITORY variable, robotpkg is able to
temporarily work with the repository defined in this variable. At the moment,
cvs, svn and git repositories are supported.
To enable this feature for a given package, you have to first instruct robotpkg
to work from a 'checkout' (instead of the stable releases) by doing 'make
checkout' in the package directory. For instance:

% cd robotpkg/foo/bar
% make checkout


This sets a permanent flag in the working directory of the package and the
checkout configuration option will be retained until the next ' make clean'.
After a 'make clean', the configuration option is set back to its default and
robotpkg will work again with stable releases. This option is set on a per
package basis only: configuring one package to work with checkouts does not
affect the behaviour of other packages.
After a 'make checkout' (and until a 'make clean'), the package has a regular
checkout in its working subdirectory. You can thus manually edit, commit,
switch branches, etc. in the package sources, like in any other repository, by
first cding into the working directory, then using the usual repository
commands (cvs, svn or git).
Of course, the individual robotpkg targets are still available from the package
entry in the robotpkg hierarchy. You can for instance 'make patch',
'configure', 'build', 'install' or 'update' as usual. Note that robotpkg is not
exactly stateless, and this is most visible when working with checkouts: for
instance, after a successful 'make build', you have to do 'make rebuild' to
force rebuilding if you have modified the sources. The same holds for
'configure' (do 'reconfigure') or 'install' (do 'reinstall', but since you
cannot install a package twice, you normally have to use 'make replace' in the
particular case of reinstalling a package).
The 'clean' target is special, in that it removes the checkout configuration
option and all checkouted sources, including locally modified sources. In order
to prevent accidental deletion of precious files, you have to confirm the
cleanign with 'clean confirm', as in:

% make clean confirm


A final remark: we STRONGLY DISCOURAGE the use of robotpkg as a development
tool (i.e. using the 'checkout' feature on a regular basis), for at least two
reasons:

  * robotpkg is not designed for this: it will not really help you in your
    daily development work, compared to the manual configuration installation
    of the software. It will sometimes create even more trouble, by ensuring
    that all the software depending on the checkouted software is up-to-date,
    which is not necessarily something you want to do every time you compile.
  * A checkout breaks the notion of 'release' and you loose all the benefits
    from working with packages. In particular, you have no clear state of what
    is installed: you cannot easily reproduce the situation of time T at time
    T+n and don't know precisely who requires which version of what. It is much
    more efficient and robust to release frequently a software in a development
    phase, than using a rolling release approach.

In our opinion, the 'checkout' target use should be limited to testing a
release candidate or quickly fix a bug and create a patch from the fix, that
you commit upstream and put in the patches/ directory until the next release.

2.3.3  Installing binary packages

At the moment, installing binary packages is not documented.

2.3.4  Removing packages

To deinstall a package, it does not matter whether it was installed from source
code or from a binary package. The robotpkg_delete command does not know it
anyway. To delete a package, you can just run robotpkg_delete <package-name>.
The package name can be given with or without version number. Wildcards can
also be used to deinstall a set of packages, for example *genom* all packages
whose name contain the word genom. Be sure to include them in quotes, so that
the shell does not expand them before robotpkg_delete sees them.
The -r option is very powerful: it removes all the packages that require the
package in question and then removes the package itself. For example:

% robotpkg_delete -r genom


will remove genom and all the packages that used it; this allows upgrading the
genom package.

2.3.5  Getting information about installed packages

The robotpkg_info shows information about installed packages or binary package
files.

2.3.6  Other administrative functions

The robotpkg_admin executes various administrative functions on the package
system.

2.4  Configuring robotpkg

The whole robotpkg system is configured via a single, centralized file, called
robotpkg.conf and placed in the /opt/openrobots/etc directory by default. This
location might be redefined during the bootstrap phase, see Section 2.2. During
the bootstrap, an initial configuration file is created with the settings you
provided to bootstrap.
The format of the configuration file is that of the usual GNU style Makefiles.
The whole robotpkg configuration is done by setting variables in this file.
Note that you can define all kinds of variables, and no special error checking
(for example for spelling mistakes) takes place, so you have to try it out to
see if it works.

2.4.1  Selecting build options

Some packages have build time options, usually to select between different
dependencies, enable optional support for big dependencies or enable
experimental features.
To see which options, if any, a package supports, and which options are
mutually exclusive, run make show-options, for example:

Any of the following general options may be selected:
    debug   Produce debugging information for binary programs
    doc     Compile documentation material
    lex     Use lex in place of flex
    tcl     Enable support for TCL clients
    yacc    Use yacc in place of bison

These options are enabled by default:
    doc tcl

These options are currently enabled:
    doc tcl


The following variables can be defined in robotpkg.conf to select which options
to enable for a package:

  * PKG_DEFAULT_OPTIONS, which can be used to select or disable options for all
    packages that support them,
  * PKG_OPTIONS.<pkgbase>, which can be used to select or disable options
    specifically for package pkgbase. Options listed in these variables are
    selected, options preceded by - are disabled.

A few examples:

PKG_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=    debug
PKG_OPTIONS.genom=      doc -tcl


It is important to note that options that were specifically suggested by the
package maintainer must be explicitely removed if you do not wish to include
the option. If you are unsure you can view the current state with make
show-options.
The following settings are consulted in the order given, and the last setting
that selects or disables an option is used:

 1. the default options as suggested by the package maintainer,
 2. PKG_DEFAULT_OPTIONS,
 3. PKG_OPTIONS.<pkgbase>

For groups of mutually exclusive options, the last option selected is used, all
others are automatically disabled. If an option of the group is explicitly
disabled, the previously selected option, if any, is used. It is an error if no
option from a required group of options is selected, and building the package
will fail.

2.4.2  Defining collections of packages

Instead of installing, removing or updating packages one-by-one, you can define
collections of packages in your robotpkg.conf. Once one or more collections are
defined, they enable special targets that work on all the packages of a
collection.
To define a collection, you have to give it a name and list the set of packages
forming the collection in the special PKGSET variable in robotpkg.conf. The
syntax is the following:

PKGSET.<name> = <list>
PKGSET_DESCR.<name> = short, optional description of the collection


where <name> is the name of the collection (any string is valid) and <list> is
the list of packages in the collection, in the form <category>/<name>. For
instance,

PKGSET.myset = architecture/genom middleware/pocolibs
PKGSET_DESCR.myset = an awesome duo


defines a collection named myset that contains the two packages genom and
pocolibs and describes itself with a rather doubtful sentence.
For each collection <name> defined in robotpkg.conf, the following targets are
available: clean-<name>, fetch-<name>, extract-<name>, install-<name>, replace-
<name>, update-<name> and deinstall-<name>. They perform the same action as
their respective counterpart without -<name> suffix, expect that they work on
all packages of the set. In addition, for the replace, update and deinstall
targets, they sort the packages in the order of their dependencies so that the
job is done a sensible order.
For the user convenience, two special targets are provided. The "installed"
collection is always defined and represents all currently installed packages.
Invoking, for instance, the update-installed target will therefore update all
currently installed packages. The "depends" collection is available only when
the current working directory is inside a package. It merely defines the
current package and all of its dependencies as the sole elements of the
collection. Invoking, for instance, the update-depends target will update all
dependencies of the package in the current directory.
Two robotpkg.conf variables affect the default behaviour of robotpkg regarding
packages sets:

PKGSET_FAILSAFE
    When working on a set, and this variable is set to yes, robotpkg will
    continue with further packages instead of stopping on an error. If set to
    'no', stop on first error. Default: no.
PKGSET_STRICT
    Specify if package sets should be considered as 'strict' or include
    dependencies of packages defined in the set. If set to 'yes', only package
    strictly defined in sets are considered. If set to 'no', dependencies of
    packages listed in sets are added to their respective sets. Default: no.

Each of these variables can be defined on a per-collection basis, by adding the
.<name> suffix to the variable name, where <name> is the name of the collection
to be configured.

2.4.3  Package specific configuration variables

In this section, you can find variables that apply to one specific package.
Each variable is suffixed by .<pkg>, where <pkg> is the actual package name to
which the variable should apply.

REPOSITORY.<pkg>
    locally overrides the default MASTER_REPOSITORY defined for a package. This
    is useful if you want to work with an alternative, perhaps local,
    repository when doing a make checkout.
CHECKOUT_VCS_OPTS.<pkg>
    is a list of options used when fetching a package via a make checkout
    command. The options are passed to the "cvs checkout", "git clone" or "svn
    checkout" command that extract the source archive.

2.4.4  General configuration variables

In this section, you can find some variables that apply to all robotpkg
packages.

ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES
    List of acceptable licenses. Whenever you try to build a package whose
    license is not in this list, you will get an error message that includes
    instructions on how to change this variable.
DISTDIR
    Where to store the downloaded copies of the original source distributions
    used for building robotpkg packages. The default is $ROBOTPKG_DIR/
    distfiles.
PACKAGES
    The top level directory for the binary packages. The default is
    $ROBOTPKG_DIR/packages.
MASTER_SITE_BACKUP
    List of backup locations for distribution files if not found locally or in
    $MASTER_SITES. The default is
    http://softs.laas.fr/openrobots/robotpkg/distfiles/.
PKG_DEBUG_LEVEL
    The level of debugging output which is displayed whilst making and
    installing the package. The default value for this is 0, which will not
    display the commands as they are executed (normal, default, quiet
    operation); the value 1 will display all shell commands before their
    invocation, and the value 2 will display both the shell commands before
    their invocation, and their actual execution progress with set -x.

2.4.5  Variables affecting the build process

WRKOBJDIR
    The top level directory where, if defined, the separate working directories
    will get created. This is useful for building packages on a different
    filesystem than the robotpkg sources.
OBJHOSTNAME
    If set to yes (the default), use hostname-specific working directories,
    e.g. work.cactus, work.localhost. OBJHOSTNAME takes precedence over
    OBJMACHINE (see below).
OBJMACHINE
    If set to yes (the default) use machine-specific working directories, e.g.
    work.Linux-i386.
DEPENDS_TARGET
    By default, dependencies are only installed, and no binary package is
    created for them. You can set this variable to package to automatically
    create binary packages after installing dependencies.
LOCALBASE
    Where packages will be installed. The default value is /opt/openrobots. Do
    not mix binary packages with different values of LOCALBASEs!
MAKE_JOBS
    When defined, specifies the maximum number of jobs that are run in parallel
    when building packages with the default action. MAKE_JOBS only affects the
    "build" target. MAKE_JOBS can be set to any positive integer; useful values
    are around the number of processors on the machine.

2.4.6  Additional flags to the compiler

If you wish to set compiler variables such as CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, FFLAGS ...
please make sure to use the += operator instead of the = operator:

CFLAGS+= -your -flags


Using CFLAGS= (i.e. without the "+") may lead to problems with packages that
need to add their own flags.
If you want to pass flags to the linker, both in the configure step and the
build step, you can do this in two ways. Either set LDFLAGS or LIBS. The
difference between the two is that LIBS will be appended to the command line,
while LDFLAGS come earlier. LDFLAGS is pre-loaded with rpath settings for
machines that support it. As with CFLAGS you should use the += operator:

LDFLAGS+= -your -linkerflags

The robotpkg developer's guide

This part of the documentation deals with creating and modifying packages.

3.1  Package files, directories and contents

Whenever you're preparing a package, there are a number of files involved which
are described in the following sections.

3.1.1  Makefile

Building, installation and creation of a package are all controlled by the
package's Makefile. The Makefile describes various things about a package, for
example from where to get it, how to configure, build, and install it.
A package Makefile contains several sections that describe the package.
In the first section there are the following variables, which should appear
exactly in the order given here. The order and grouping of the variables is
mostly historical and has no further meaning.

PKGREVISION
    Defines the robotpkg revision number of the package. This should not be set
    for a new package. See Section  for details.
MASTER_SITES
    In simple cases, MASTER_SITES defines all URLs from where the distfile,
    whose name is derived from the DISTNAME variable, is fetched.
    When actually fetching the distfiles, each item from MASTER_SITES gets the
    name of each distfile appended to it, without an intermediate slash.
    Therefore, all site values have to end with a slash or other separator
    character. This allows for example to set MASTER_SITES to a URL of a CGI
    script that gets the name of the distfile as a parameter. In this case, the
    definition would look like:

        MASTER_SITES= http://www.example.com/download.cgi?file=

    There are some predefined values for MASTER_SITES, which can be used in
    packages. The names of the variables should speak for themselves.

        ${MASTER_SITE_SOURCEFORGE}
        ${MASTER_SITE_GNU}
        ${MASTER_SITE_OPENROBOTS}

    If you choose one of these predefined sites, you may want to specify a
    subdirectory of that site. Since these macros may expand to more than one
    actual site, you must use the following construct to specify a
    subdirectory:

        MASTER_SITES= ${MASTER_SITE_SOURCEFORGE:=project_name/}

    Note the trailing slash after the subdirectory name.
FETCH_METHOD
    This is the method used to download the distfile from MASTER_SITES. It
    defaults to 'archive' which corresponds to the normal situation where
    distfile is an archive available from MASTER_SITES, so it normally needs
    not to be set.
    However, it can happen that a software provider does not provide any
    archive available for download but has only a public repository. In this
    case, FETCH_METHOD can be set to cvs, git or svn according to the kind of
    repository available. MASTER_SITES is then interpreted as a repository of
    the form url[@revision[+module]], where the bits between square brackets
    are optional and refer to a particular revision and module in the
    repository located at url. url can take any form supported by the
    underlying fetch tool (cvs, git or svn). It is strongly advised to define
    at least a specific revision to be checked out, so that the package can be
    reproducibly installed in a known state.
MASTER_REPOSITORY
    defines a VCS repository from where a "make checkout" will download the
    latest revision of a software. MASTER_REPOSITORY is a list of 2 or 3
    elements. The first element is the VCS tool to be used: it must be one of
    cvs, git or svn. The second element is the location of the repository. It
    must be written in a syntax understood by the actual VCS tool. The third
    optional element is a list of specific elements to be checked out instead
    of the default (the whole repository).
CHECKOUT_VCS_OPTS
    is a list of options used when fetching a package via a make checkout
    command. The options are passed to the "cvs checkout", "git clone" or "svn
    checkout" command that extract the source archive.

The second section contains information about separately downloaded patches, if
any.

PATCHFILES
    Name(s) of additional files that contain distribution patches distributed
    by the author or other maintainers. There is no default. robotpkg will look
    for them at PATCH_SITES. They will automatically be uncompressed before
    patching if the names end with .gz or .Z.
PATCH_SITES
    Primary location(s) for distribution patch files (see PATCHFILES above) if
    not found locally.

The third section contains the following variables.

MAINTAINER
    is the email address of the person who feels responsible for this package,
    and who is most likely to look at problems or questions regarding this
    package. Other developers may contact the MAINTAINER before making changes
    to the package, but are not required to do so. When packaging a new
    program, set MAINTAINER to yourself. If you really can't maintain the
    package for future updates, set it to <robotpkg@laas.fr>.
HOMEPAGE
    is a URL where users can find more information about the package.
COMMENT
    is a one-line description of the package (should not include the package
    name).
LICENSE
    Denoting that a package may be installed and used according to a particular
    license is done by placing the license in robotpkg/licenses and setting the
    LICENSE variable to a string identifying the license file, e.g. in shell/
    eltclsh:

        LICENSE= 2-clause-bsd

    The license tag mechanism is intended to address copyright-related issues
    surrounding building, installing and using a package, and not to address
    redistribution issues (see RESTRICTED and NO_PUBLIC_SRC, etc.). Packages
    with redistribution restrictions should set these tags.

Other variables affecting the build process may be gathered in their own
section. They are described in the next sections of this chapter.

3.1.2  distinfo

The distinfo file contains the message digest, or checksum, of each distfile
needed for the package. This ensures that the distfiles retrieved from the
Internet have not been corrupted during transfer or altered by a malign force
to introduce a security hole. Due to recent rumor about weaknesses of digest
algorithms, all distfiles are protected using both SHA1 and RMD160 message
digests, as well as the file size.
The distinfo file also contains the checksums for all the patches found in the
patches directory (see Section 3.1.4).
To regenerate the distinfo file, use the make distinfo or make mdi command.

3.1.3  PLIST

This file governs the files that are installed on your system: all the
binaries, manual pages, etc. There are other directives which may be entered in
this file, to control the creation and deletion of directories, and the
location of inserted files.
The names used in the PLIST are relative to the installation prefix ( $
{PREFIX}), which means that it cannot register files outside this directory
(absolute path names are not allowed). As a general sanity rule, robotpkg must
not alter any files outside ${PREFIX} anyway and, in particular, not modify
automatically existing configuration files. If a package needs to install files
outside ${PREFIX}, the best option is to install them with robotpkg inside $
{PREFIX} (e.g. ${PREFIX}/etc or ${PREFIX}/var) and create a MESSAGE file that
will instruct the user to manually link or copy the files in question to their
final location. See the package hardware/ieee1394-kmod for an example of such
package.
In order to create or update a PLIST, you can use the make print-PLIST command
to output a PLIST that matches any new installed files since the package was
extracted. This command will generate a PLIST.guess file which you must move
manually to PLIST after reviewing the result of the semi-automatic generation.

3.1.4  patches/*

Some packages may not work out-of-the box with robotpkg. Therefore, a number of
custom patch files may be needed to make the package work. These patch files
are found in the patches/ directory. If you want to share patches between
multiple packages in robotpkg, e.g. because they use the same distfiles, set
PATCHDIR to the path where the patch files can be found, e.g.:

    PATCHDIR= ../../devel/boost/patches

The file names of the patch files must be of the form patch-*, and they are
usually named patch-[a-z][a-z]. In the patch phase, these patches are
automatically applied to the files in ${WRKSRC} directory after extracting
them, in alphabetic order.
The patch-* files should be in diff -bu format, and apply without a fuzz to
avoid problems. (To force patches to apply with fuzz you can set
PATCH_FUZZ_FACTOR=-F2 in a package's Makefile).
Each patch file should be commented so that any developer who knows the code of
the application can make some use of the patch. Special care should be taken
for the upstream developers, since we generally want that they accept robotpkg
patches, so there is less work in the future. When adding a patch that corrects
a problem in the distfile (rather than e.g. enforcing robotpkg's view of where
man pages should go), send the patch as a bug report to the maintainer. This
benefits non-robotpkg users of the package, and usually makes it possible to
remove the patch in future version.
When you add or modify existing patch files, remember to generate the checksums
for the patch files by using the make mdi command, see Section 3.1.2.

3.2  General operation

3.2.1  Incrementing versions when fixing an existing package

When making fixes to an existing package it can be useful to change the version
number in PKGNAME. To avoid conflicting with future versions by the original
author, a "r1", "r2", ... suffix can be used on package versions by setting
PKGREVISION=1 (2, ...) in the package Makefile. E.g.

    DISTNAME= foo-17.42
    PKGREVISION= 9

will result in a PKGNAME of "foo-17.42r9". The "r" is treated like a "." by the
package tools.
PKGREVISION should be incremented for any non-trivial change in the resulting
binary package. Without a PKGREVISION bump, someone with the previous version
installed has no way of knowing that their package is out of date. Thus,
changes without increasing PKGREVISION are essentially labeled "this is so
trivial that no reasonable person would want to upgrade", and this is the rough
test for when increasing PKGREVISION is appropriate. Examples of changes that
do not merit increasing PKGREVISION are:

  * Changing HOMEPAGE, MAINTAINER or comments in Makefile.
  * Changing build variables if the resulting binary package is the same.
  * Changing DESCR.
  * Adding PKG_OPTIONS if the default options don't change.

Examples of changes that do merit an increase to PKGREVISION include:

  * Security fixes
  * Changes or additions to a patch file
  * Changes to the PLIST
  * A dependency is changed or renamed.

PKGREVISION must also be incremented when dependencies have ABI changes.
When a new release of the package is released, the PKGREVISION must be removed.

3.2.2  Substituting variable text in the package files (the SUBST framework)

When you want to replace the same text in multiple files or when the
replacement text varies, patches alone cannot help. This is where the SUBST
framework comes in. It provides an easy-to-use interface for replacing text in
files. Example:

   SUBST_CLASSES+=           fix-paths
   SUBST_STAGE.fix-paths=    pre-configure
   SUBST_MESSAGE.fix-paths=  Fixing absolute paths.
   SUBST_FILES.fix-paths=    src/*.c
   SUBST_SED.fix-paths=      -e 's,"/usr/local,"${PREFIX},g'


SUBST_CLASSES is a list of identifiers that are used to identify the different
SUBST blocks that are defined. The SUBST framework is used by robotpkg , so it
is important to always use the += operator with this variable. Otherwise some
substitutions may be skipped.
The remaining variables of each SUBST block are parameterized with the
identifier from the first line (fix-paths in this case).
SUBST_STAGE.* specifies the stage at which the replacement will take place. All
combinations of pre-, do- and post- together with a phase name are possible,
though only few are actually used. Most commonly used are post-patch and
pre-configure. Of these two, pre-configure should be preferred because then it
is possible to run make patch and have the state after applying the patches but
before making any other changes. This is especially useful when you are
debugging a package in order to create new patches for it. Similarly,
post-build is preferred over pre-install, because the install phase should
generally be kept as simple as possible. When you use post-build, you have the
same files in the working directory that will be installed later, so you can
check if the substitution has succeeded.
SUBST_MESSAGE.* is an optional text that is printed just before the
substitution is done.
SUBST_FILES.* is the list of shell globbing patterns that specifies the files
in which the substitution will take place. The patterns are interpreted
relatively to the WRKSRC directory.
SUBST_SED.* is a list of arguments to sed(1) that specify the actual
substitution. Every sed command should be prefixed with -e, so that all SUBST
blocks look uniform.
There are some more variables, but they are so seldomly used that they are only
documented in the mk/internal/subst.mk file.

3.3  The build phase

For building a package, a rough equivalent of the following code is executed.

   for d in ${BUILD_DIRS}; do                \
      cd ${WRKSRC}                           \
      && cd ${d}                             \
      && env ${MAKE_ENV}                     \
         ${MAKE_PROGRAM} ${BUILD_MAKE_FLAGS} \
            -f ${MAKE_FILE}                  \
            ${BUILD_TARGET}
   done


The following variables affecting the build process of a package may be defined
in a package Makefile:

NO_BUILD
    (default: unset). If there is no build step at all, set NO_BUILD to "yes".
MAKE_PROGRAM
    (default: MAKE) is the program used to perform the actual build in a
    package.
BUILD_DIRS
    (default: ".") is a list of pathnames relative to WRKSRC. In each of these
    directories, MAKE_PROGRAM is run with the environment MAKE_ENV and
    arguments BUILD_MAKE_FLAGS.
BUILD_TARGET
    (default: "all") is the default make target for building the package.
MAKE_JOBS_SAFE
    Whether the package supports parallel builds. If set to yes, at most
    MAKE_JOBS jobs are carried out in parallel. The default value is "yes", and
    packages that don't support it must explicitly set it to "no".
